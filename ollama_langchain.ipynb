Stress embodies the condition of imbalance experienced by an individual between\\nthe demands of a given situation and his or her ability to meet them (eg, Cooper, Dewe, & O'Driscoll, 2001; McGrath,\\n1976). The phenomenon of technostress investigates how and why the use of IS causes various demands on the\\nindividual. It finds wide‐ranging practice and policy related relevance as evidenced by mention in practitioner writing1\\nand legislation.2 It is a relatively young phenomenon from the scholarly point of view and the IS literature on\\ntechnostress is fairly nascent in that scholarly empirical work was first reported in a mainstream IS journal about\\n10 years ago (Tarafdar, Qiang, Ragu‐Nathan, & Ragu‐Nathan, 2007). Further, it is interdisciplinary in nature because\\nit embodies “complementarity” (Orlikowski & Barley, 2001) and a theoretical link between the literatures of IS and\\npsychological stress. It is also a continually evolving phenomenon as new types of IS (that include new devices\\nand applications) and their use persistently emerge and reveal novel aspects of it.\\nAs currently comprised, the literature on technostress focuses on demands relating to the use of IS that the\\nindividual finds unable to meet and that lead to adverse consequences. It conceptualizes the use of IS as a stress\\ncreator. However, we are beginning to see both scholarly (eg, Ohly & Latour, 2014) and practice‐based\\naccounts (eg, Eurofound and the International Labour Office, 2017) of how the very characteristics of IS such as\\nconstant connectivity and ubiquity that are associated with technostress creating conditions and their negative\\noutcomes, can also challenge individuals to harness them for positive consequences such as greater work flexibility.\\nWe also note the emergence of “digital detox” applications and “email assistants” (Kokkalis et al., 2013)3 wherein\\nthe use of particular IS can help individuals deal with technostress creating conditions such as technology‐related\\ninvasion and overload. These sorts of examples suggest that technostress is an embodiment of a theoretically more\\nnuanced and “messy” (Lundberg & Cooper, 2011) relationship between IS use and well‐being than what current\\nliterature indicates. Although the literature shows evidence of accumulating many concepts and relationships, it does\\nnot address these emerging developments. Similarly, the psychological stress literature while acknowledging that\\ntechnology can be a source of stress (eg, Barber & Santuzzi, 2015) has not theoretically developed the link between\\nstress and technology.\\nEmerging literatures that focus on complex, interdisciplinary, and evolving phenomenon can benefit from\\nexposure to foundational theoretical concepts and structure early on, as guidance for coherent development going\\nforward (Webster & Watson, 2002). The primary objective of this paper is thus to develop a framework for guiding\\nfuture research on the phenomenon of technostress experienced by individuals in organizations. We believe that such\\nan effort would be valuable for the development of the technostress literature for the following reasons. First, it\\nwould provide a foundation for theoretically reframing and extending the current ambit of its conceptualization to\\ntake into account emerging developments. Second, it would serve to identify and integrate conceptual themes and\\nrelationships constituting the phenomenon, thus developing a theoretically rigorous framing through which future\\nscholarly efforts can be directed. Third, it would articulate how the IS literatures on technostress and the non‐IS\\nliteratures that study psychological stress can mutually enrich and inform one another.\\nTo do this, it is necessary to understand the current theoretical expositions of technostress. A secondary objective\\nis therefore to conduct a review of the literature and critically analyse the state of current research on technostress.\\nIn laying out directions for future research, the paper challenges current ideas in the technostress literature in 3\\nways. First, it develops the argument that, in contrast to the much examined negative outcomes, technostress can be\\nharnessed as motivation for positive outcomes such as greater effectiveness and innovation at work. Second, it suggests\\nthat in addition to being a stress creator, the role of IS in the technostress phenomenon should be expanded to that of\\nTARAFDAR ET AL.\\n7\\n 13652575, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/isj.12169 by Athens University Economics & Bus, Wiley Online Library on [29/01/2024].

Section 6 presents discussions\\nand concluding comments.\\n2\\n|\\nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND\\nEarly scholarly approaches considered the term “stress” as either a “response” or a “stimulus.” The response‐based\\napproach focused on a medical/physiological perspective (McGrath, 1976; Selye, 1956). It viewed stress as a\\ndependent variable, usually a medical or physiological condition of the individual. Disturbing stimuli, usually\\ndifficult life situations were considered the causal, independent variables. The stimulus‐based approach had its basis\\nin engineering and physical sciences. It considered stress as an independent variable, a force exerted on an individual,\\nwhich resulted in a negative reaction. The shortcomings of these approaches were that they (Cooper et al., 2001) (1)\\nfocused on either the stimulus or response, but did not explain how and why one led to the other; (2) ignored the\\nimportance of the individual and the individual differences in the perceptual and cognitive processes underpinning\\nthese relationships; and (3) did not consider why the individual perceived a situation as stressful and what they could\\ndo to deal with. Hence they are conceptually limited and inadequate for explaining stress experienced by users in\\norganizations, a more complex psychological phenomenon, wherein individuals subjectively react differently to different\\nsituations, experience different forms of disturbances, and exhibit different manifestations of their experience of stress\\n(eg, Cooper et al., 2001; Cooper & Dewe, 2008; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Pearlin, Menaghan, Lieberman, & Mullan, 1981).\\nTo reflect these realities, theories that study psychological stress have embodied a processual approach, where\\nthe phenomenon of stress is seen as a process that involves a transaction between the individual and the environ-\\nment. Stress is neither in the individual (ie, the response) nor in the environment (ie, the force), but an ongoing process\\nof individuals transacting with their environments. Stress is a process that includes (1) the presence of environmental\\ncondition, which the individual appraises as a (2) demand or stressor that is significantly taxing on his or her resources,\\nwhich sets into motion (3) coping responses that lead to (4) psychological, behavioural and physiological outcomes\\nexperienced by the individual. Described in various seminal texts under the overall theoretical framing of theTransac-\\ntional Theory of Stress (eg, Cooper et al., 2001; Folkman, 2011; Kahn & Byosiere, 1992; Lazarus, 1966; Lazarus &\\nFolkman, 1984; McGrath, 1976), such a framing has provided a widely adopted foundation for understanding stress\\nexperienced by individuals in organizations, most notably because it addresses the complex and messy nature of\\nhow the phenomenon of psychological stress unfolds.4\\nThe stress process provides a conceptual starting point for understanding technostress. Accordingly, the phenom-\\nenon of technostress, which addresses the context in which the stress process is activated due to the use of IS, has\\nbeen conceptualized over the course of multiple studies, in this framing, as a process (eg, Ayyagari et al., 2011; D'Arcy,\\nHerath, & Shoss, 2014; Galluch, Grover, & Thatcher, 2015; Ragu‐Nathan et al., 2008).5 Technostress is a process that\\nincludes (1) the presence of “technology environmental conditions”; which are appraised as (2) demands or “techno‐\\nstressors” that are taxing on the individual and require a change; which set into motion (3) “coping responses”; that\\nlead to (4) psychological, physical, and behavioural “outcomes” for the individual. “Primary appraisal” focuses on the\\nindividual's assessment of the extent of demand and influences the relationship between technology environmental\\nconditions and techno‐stressors. “Secondary appraisal” secondary appraisal focuses on the individual's evaluation of\\navailability of options and resources to respond to the stressful situation. It influences the relationship between the\\ntechno‐stressors and coping responses.\\n8\\nTARAFDAR ET AL.\\n 13652575, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/isj.12169 by Athens University Economics & Bus, Wiley Online Library on [29/01/2024].

These include the IS discipline, and the non‐IS disciplines of organizational behaviour,\\npsychological stress, and other cognate disciplines where workplace stress has been studied. The literature review\\nincluded the following considerations—(1) selection of disciplinary corpus, keywords and journals; (2) article selection\\nthrough initial query run and backward and forward search; and (3) article classification. These steps are presented\\nin detail in Appendices A, B, and C. To describe here briefly, for each discipline, we selected the set of leading journals\\nand searched for relevant keywords in titles, abstracts and keywords of all articles published since 1995, to generate\\nan approximately 20 year (1995‐2016) horizon for our search. The starting year of 1995 is prior to the uptake of\\npervasive, mobile, multi‐device, and multi‐application use of IS, which are key drivers of technostress. A total\\nof 182 articles were retrieved and analysed, to ultimately select 27 articles. We find that the articles covered the\\nfollowing aspects of technostress: “Technology Environmental Conditions, Techno‐Stressors, Coping Responses,\\nOutcomes, and Moderators of stressor‐outcome relationship.” Table 1 tabulates and describes each concept, as it\\nemerged collectively from the papers in our corpus that covered it. We describe them next.\\n3.1\\n|\\nTechnology environmental conditions\\nThese are characteristics of IS that have the potential to create a demand in the individual—namely, ubiquity,\\nreliability, ease of use, mobility, and presenteeism. They also include IS‐related events such as system breakdown\\nand technology created interruptions (Ayyagari et al., 2011; Galluch et al., 2015).\\n3.2\\n|\\nTechno‐stressors\\nThese are stressors appraised by the individual as damaging. Overload from the use of IS, techno‐overload, forces the\\nuser to do more to use the technology (Reinke & Chamorro‐Premuzic, 2014; Tarafdar et al., 2007), to adhere to extra\\norganizational security requirements regarding its use (D'Arcy et al., 2014), to attend to expectations of others when\\nusing applications such as social media (Maier et al., 2014) or to deal with excess information and features (Zhang\\net al., 2016). Techno‐invasion is the stressor where the user feels non‐work time to be invaded by work demands\\n(Tarafdar et al., 2007), is faced with expectations of constant availability and immediate response, and has privacy\\ninvaded by surveillance and monitoring (Barber & Santuzzi, 2015; Day et al., 2012; Sprigg & Jackson, 2006). Individ-\\nuals experience techno‐uncertainty as a stressor when they feel that IS change quickly (Maier et al., 2015; Tarafdar\\net al., 2007), important technology related decisions are not communicated to them (Barber & Santuzzi, 2015; Day\\net al., 2012), and they do not have control over IS use policies around, for instance, IS security (D'Arcy et al., 2014).\\nTechno‐insecurity embodies the feeling of insecurity that individuals face when they feel that others may know more\\nabout new technologies than they do (Tarafdar et al., 2007). Techno‐complexity is the stressor that individuals\\nexperience because they have to constantly learn how to use IS (Barber & Santuzzi, 2015; Barley et al., 2011; Day\\net al., 2012; Sprigg & Jackson, 2006; Tarafdar et al., 2007); find it difficult to understand IS use policies (D'Arcy\\net al., 2014); or may be faced with too many interruptions, complications, and hassles in using IS (Barber & Santuzzi,\\n2015; Galluch et al., 2015). Factors that affect the level of techno‐stressors include the attitude of the individual's\\ntoward IS (Barley et al., 2011), workload, work complexity, digital literacy, and user involvement (Barber & Santuzzi,\\n2015; Chen et al., 2009; Korunka & Vitouch, 1999; Tarafdar et al., 2010, 2015).\\n3.3\\n|\\nOutcomes\\nOutcomes have been studied as nonbeneficial or adverse consequences emanating from a direct relationship with the\\nvarious techno‐stressors.

The individual's control over whether he or she can access information relating to a task or\\ntake a break from the task has both positive and negative moderating effects (Galluch et al., 2015).\\n4\\n|\\nANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE\\nWe analyse in this section, the key aspects of the literature that reports on technostress.\\n4.1\\n|\\nTechnostress as a dark side phenomenon\\nThe overarching and exclusive premise of the literature regarding technostress is that of a phenomenon associated\\nwith negative consequences. The literature explains only how demands from the technology environmental\\nconditions are appraised as stressful in a threatening and negative way. The techno‐stressors are appraisals of the\\ntechnology environment as threatening and the outcomes examined are adverse consequences.\\nHowever, not all stressors are detrimental to the individual. In addition to presenting difficulties and threats,\\nstressors can also enthuse and encourage individuals in positive ways. There is a distinct qualitative difference\\nbetween the stress associated with creative involvement, for instance, and that associated with excessive workload\\n(Selye, 1974). The second can be damaging when the individual feels threatened because of an inability to handle\\nit, and the first can be stimulating when it challenges the individual in a positive way. The first signifies motivation\\nand a “hunger for achievement” (Selye, 1974, p. 82), and the second, damage and inability. Stress is therefore a\\ndual‐hued phenomenon, and individuals can thus appraise environmental conditions as both threatening and\\nchallenging; the respective outcomes can be damaging and beneficial respectively (eg, Lazarus, 1966).\\nThe notions of “Eustress” and “Distress” describe these two distinct scenarios associated with stress (Selye, 1974).\\nEustress is broadly referred to as stress that creates a challenge or an opportunity, and distress as stress that creates a\\nthreat or hindrance. Based on various studies, it can be suggested that distress is associated with a negative appraisal\\nof demands in the environment that have the potential to thwart attainment of positive objectives and goals. Eustress\\nconstitutes a positive appraisal of demands in the environment that have the potential to promote personal growth\\nand gain (Cavanaugh, Boswell, Roehling, & Boudreau, 2000; Cooper et al., 2001; Crawford, LePine, & Rich, 2010;\\nFay, Sonnentag, & Frese, 1998; Le Fevre, Matheny, & Kolt, 2003). The implementation of a new system, for instance,\\ncan be appraised as a threat or as an opportunity, upon which different kinds of adaptation behaviours are engaged in,\\nleading to different kinds of outcomes (Beaudry & Pinsonneault, 2005).\\nHowever, the technostress literature has focused on the distress aspect of stress and does not explain how the\\ndemands from the technology environment can be appraised as challenging and motivating, leading to potentially\\npositive outcomes. As reinforcement of the practical relevance of this literature gap, we are beginning to see\\nemployees responding to IS characteristics such as reliability, ubiquity and mobility, by challenging themselves to\\nleverage these for greater work flexibility.6 There is a need for IS research to examine and explain the positive facet\\nof technostress.\\n4.2\\n|\\nIS use as a cause of technostress\\nThe literature considers the use of IS as triggers and causes that set in motion the process of technostress. Yet we see\\nare beginning to see instances in practice, of IS applications such as “e‐mail personal assistants” that prioritize e‐mail\\n(eg, Kokkalis et al., 2013) and machine learning algorithms that filter spam e‐mail (Guzella & Caminhas, 2009). Such\\napplications can potentially help people deal with techno‐stressors such as techno‐overload. However, we did not find\\na single study in our literature review where the role of IS in helping to mitigate negative outcomes from technostress\\nwas examined. The current technostress literature does not provide an understanding of design principles for such IS.\\nWe thus do not know how IS that could evaluate and affect key variables of the technostress process, can be designed.\\n12\\nTARAFDAR ET AL.\\n 13652575, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/isj.12169 by Athens University Economics & Bus, Wiley Online Library on [29/01/2024].

However, as we see in Table 1, all aspects of it have not been investigated to the same extent. While\\ntechno‐stressors and aspects of the technology environment have been examined, studies have not looked at primary\\nor secondary appraisal, that is, the influencers of the relationship between environmental conditions and techno‐\\nstressors or between techno‐stressors and coping responses. Studies on coping responses are also limited and do\\nnot explain how they affect outcomes. Further, most studies examine a direct relationship between techno‐stressors\\nand outcomes and its moderators, without considering the appraisal and coping processes.\\n4.4\\n|\\nLack of interdisciplinary theoretical enrichment\\nWe find that the study of technostress in the IS literature, in conceptually framing technostress in the transaction\\nmodel of stress, has referenced theoretical concepts from the psychological stress literature. While IS specific\\nconcepts have been developed for technostress creators and technology environment conditions, many of the key\\nIS related variables and processes that constitute distinctive aspects of the phenomenon of technostress such as\\ncoping responses, appraisal and outcomes, are under‐studied, and the related insights have not been incorporated into\\nthe understanding of psychological stress. This presents a substantive opportunity to develop the technostress\\nliterature in a way that furthers mutual and interdisciplinary theoretical enrichment between the literature in IS and\\npsychological stress.\\n4.5\\n|\\nMethods\\nTechnostress being a process, it is not possible to measure “technostress” as such. The presence of technostress has\\nbeen assessed through the presence of the different variables and relationships that constitute it—techno‐stressors,\\ncoping responses, and outcome or strain variables. We find (see Appendix C) that most empirical studies have\\nreported on quantitative data collected through survey methods. Among the exceptions were as follows: 5 studies\\nthat had experimental research designs, one study that was based on qualitative interviews, and one study that\\nreported on both qualitative and quantitative. The experimental research designs simulated tasks from standard\\npsychology tests rather than on organizational tasks. Two of them reported on physiological measures—presence of\\nthe salivary alpha amylase—as outcomes. In one of them (Galluch et al., 2015), results from the survey measure did\\nnot corroborate with those from the physiological measure. One paper was conceptual and did not report on any\\nempirical data.\\n5\\n|\\nFRAMING FUTURE RESEARCH—THE TECHNOSTRESS TRIFECTA\\nBased on the literature analysis in Section 4 and the background presented in Sections 2 and 3, we present our\\nframework for guiding future research in technostress in the form of a trifecta as shown in Figure 1. Its first aspect\\nis “techno‐eustress,” which explains how individuals appraise IS as challenging or thrilling, and experience consequent\\n“good” stress which motivates them to engage in coping behaviours that lead to positive outcomes. Its second\\naspect is “techno‐distress,” which explains the processes by which individuals appraise IS as a threat, experience\\nconsequent “bad” stress, and are faced largely with detrimental outcomes. Each of these two aspects is associated\\nwith a distinct process. The third aspect explains “how IS can be designed,” for, respectively, enhancing\\ntechno‐eustress and mitigating techno‐distress.\\nTARAFDAR ET AL.\\n13\\n 13652575, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/isj.12169 by Athens University Economics & Bus, Wiley Online Library on [29/01/2024].

These are discussed next and summarized in Table 2.\\nFigure 2 presents our conceptualization of the techno‐eustress and techno‐distress aspects of the trifecta. It\\ndraws from the theoretical framing of the transactional approach to studying technostress. We conceptualize\\ntechno‐eustress and techno‐distress as two distinct transactional phenomena. Each phenomenon unfolds differently,\\nbut within the overall framing of the transactional approach. That is, each has conceptually similar but qualitatively\\ndifferent concepts and relationships among them. In the next two subsections, we describe each in greater detail.\\n5.1\\n|\\nTechno‐eustress\\nTechno‐eustress is the phenomenon that embodies the positive stress that individuals face in their use of IS. As\\nshown in the top half of Figure 2, individuals appraise the characteristics of IS as challenges that they are motivated\\nto tackle because they expect that doing so is within their wherewithal and would lead to betterment, activate coping\\nbehaviours to master the challenges in a positive way, and achieve largely affirmative and positive outcomes. In doing\\nall of this, the individual experiences the process of “eustress” or “good” technostress.\\n5.1.1\\n|\\nChallenge techno‐stressors\\nChallenge stressors are perceived as opportunities or options for change, learn, achieve, and reward (Cooper et al.,\\n2001; Fay et al., 1998). The individual experiences “challenge” techno‐stressors when the characteristics of IS are\\nperceived to present the opportunity and option for enhancing and improvement the individual's skills, tasks, and\\nwork life. Recent studies show for instance that individuals can push themselves to learn how to use apps on\\nsmartphones and tablets to enhance their flexibility across different tasks, contexts, and the work‐home boundary\\n(eg, Diaz, Chiaburu, Zimmerman, & Boswell, 2012; Leung, 2011; Ohly & Latour, 2014). It is important to understand\\nwhat these challenge stressors are to evaluate the ways in which the individual can feel challenged. We thus ask\\nthe question: How can challenge techno‐stressors be conceptualized? What demands do individuals experience from the\\ncharacteristics of IS that they find thrilling, enjoyable or motivating?\\n5.1.2\\n|\\nPrimary appraisal for challenge stressors\\nParticular individual and organizational characteristics increase the likelihood that the characteristics of IS are\\nperceived as challenge stressors.

Such individuals may perceive IS characteristics such as\\npresentism and reliability as enablers for accessing and processing information when they need it, and for increasing\\ntheir ability to be flexible and productive (Boswell & Olson‐Buchanan, 2007; Ohly & Latour, 2014). Or, individuals who\\nare open to experience, actively try out and seek new situations, think creatively and unconventionally, or show high\\nlevels of initiative and innovativeness with IS (Agarwal & Prasad, 1998). They may perceive IS functionality as an\\nopportunity for innovative use. They would evaluate IS characteristics such as pace of change, sophistication, and\\nflexibility as opportunities to creatively use and experiment with new IS functionalities and features; they would thus\\nbe challenged by them to enhance their work.\\nParticular job characteristics or aspects of organization culture can aid in the primary appraisal for challenge\\ntechno‐stressors. Job characteristics that combine high levels of job responsibility with time pressure may propel\\nindividuals to turn toward IS to increase their efficiency and performance (Cavanaugh et al., 2000). A culture of\\ninnovation makes it acceptable to take risks (Amabile, Conti, Coon, Lazenby, & Herron, 1996). In organizations having\\nsuch a culture, flexibility of IS may be seen as an opportunity for the creative use of technology for work tasks, and\\nthe pace of change of IS, as a challenge for using new technologies for innovative work processes. Additionally, a\\nculture of involvement enables influential roles for users in IS planning, development, and implementation (Doll &\\nTorkzadeh, 1989). In such a culture, users are familiar with the system, understand how to use its features, and make\\nbetter assessments about task‐technology fit (Beaudry & Pinsonneault, 2005). Armed with this knowledge, they may\\nperceive technology characteristics such as flexibility, as opportunities that challenge them to improve their tasks, by\\nusing IS in different ways.\\nUnderstanding what these personal and organizational factors are, is necessary to explain what helps in the\\nappraisal of challenge stressors, so that we ask: What individual and organizational factors increase the likelihood that\\nthe characteristics of IS are perceived as challenge stressors? How do these factors strengthen the relationship between\\ntechnology characteristics and challenge techno‐stressors?\\n5.1.3\\n|\\nChallenge coping responses\\nA key psychological concept critical to dealing with challenges is that of mastery, which denotes the successful\\nmeeting and dealing with difficulties (Murphy, 1962). Mastery focuses the individual's actions toward leveraging\\nthe opportunities associated with the challenge, for achievement and fulfilment (Lazarus, 1966; Lazarus & Folkman,\\n1984). Challenge coping represents such actions and is directed toward achieving competence and mastery. They\\nare activated when the individual experiences challenge techno‐stressors. They can be related to the individual's\\nuse of IS and the task.\\nCoping responses can be affect‐based or action‐based (Folkman et al., 1896; Lazarus, 1966; Lazarus & Folkman,\\n1984). They can exist simultaneously (Fay et al., 1998). For the former, IS use related coping emotions that spur the\\nindividual to act in positive ways could include excitement and anticipation (Beaudry & Pinsonneault, 2010). With\\nrespect to the latter, IS use‐related coping behaviours can focus on experimenting with different types of use such\\nas—exploring and trying new features (Barki, Titah, & Boffo, 2007; Beaudry & Pinsonneault, 2005; Jasperson, Carter,\\n& Zmud, 2005), using more features (Sun, 2012), and uncovering new uses for existing features (Jasperson et al.,\\n2005; Singletary, Akbulut, & Houston, 2002). They would entail proactively “stretching” and learning to use new IS\\nand seeking support for doing so (Beaudry & Pinsonneault, 2010; DeSanctis & Poole, 1994; Orlikowski & Gash,\\n1994). Task‐related coping behaviours are focused on innovations and adaptations in task and work practices\\nusing IS (Beaudry & Pinsonneault, 2010; Majchrzak & Cotton, 1988). Task innovation could include, for instance,\\ndeveloping new solutions for customers using a customer relationship management system (Tarafdar et al., 2015).\\nWork practice innovation could include discretionary and mindful smartphone use for work‐related tasks at home\\nto achieve flexibility (Fenner & Renn, 2010), productive multi‐tasking during meetings when the individual is not\\ndirectly contributing or speaking, by working simultaneously on other IS‐mediated tasks (Ohly & Latour, 2014), use\\nof IS to engage in back and forth between different types of communications and interactions during the course of\\n18\\nTARAFDAR ET AL.\\n 13652575, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/isj.12169 by Athens University Economics & Bus, Wiley Online Library on [29/01/2024].

Recent research supports such scenarios and\\nsuggests that boundaries across different work tasks can be blurred in a constructive and helpful way (eg, Leung,\\n2011) through the use of IS. We therefore ask the following: What IS use related and task related coping responses\\nare activated to deal with challenge techno‐stressors that helps individuals achieve mastery over IS use for work tasks?\\n5.1.4\\n|\\nSecondary appraisal for challenge coping responses\\nSecondary appraisal for challenge coping increases the likelihood that individuals evaluate and engage in various\\nchallenge coping responses. Factors that could influence secondary appraisal are the individual's technology\\nskills, organizational norms regarding particular tasks, and the individual's organizational role.\\nIn terms of technology skills, individuals with high technology competence, that is, those who can use IS\\nproductively and with ease (Tarafdar et al., 2015), are likely to be motivated and stimulated by and thrive on, creative\\nand exploratory uses of IS. Similarly, those with a high intrinsic motivation to use IS (Ryan & Deci, 2000) would\\nproactively engage in IS use for the fun and challenge it provides. Recent findings show that intrinsic motivation\\nmay be a positive factor in people using smartphones for changing their work practices (Ohly & Latour, 2014).\\nOrganizational expectations and norms regarding how particular tasks should be regarded are likely to be important\\nto secondary appraisal because they influence how individuals use IS to accomplish their tasks (DeSanctis & Poole,\\n1994; Orlikowski, 1992). In organizations where prompt and constant interaction with high‐value and demanding\\nclients is expected, employees may attune their work practices toward maximum availability and would accordingly\\nuse IS to ensure that they can be reached by clients (Mazmanian, Orlikowski, & Yates, 2013). These sorts of\\norganizational expectations influence the likelihood that the individual reacts to the challenge stressors by engaging\\nin IS use and task‐related coping behaviours that enable them to achieve mastery over their work. In terms of the\\nindividual's role, frontline roles such as call centre management and customer service require support to the customer.\\nIndividuals in such roles are likely to engage in coping behaviours that enable them to answer questions from\\nand engage in communication with customers (Wajcman & Rose, 2011). As another example, knowledge workers\\nneed to keep abreast of latest developments in their fields. Individuals in such roles may respond to challenge\\nstressors by using IS to receive information alerts from important journals and databases.\\nWe thus ask the following questions: What individual, organizational and role related factors increase the likelihood\\nof the individual activating challenge coping responses when they face challenge techno‐stressors? How do these factors\\ninfluence the relationship between challenge techno‐stressors and challenge coping responses?\\n5.1.5\\n|\\nPositive outcomes\\nOutcomes beneficial to the individual are expected to occur in the techno‐eustress process. Such outcomes embody\\naffirmative and positively reinforcing impacts for the individual. They could include, for example, improved\\nperformance, increased efficiency, and enhanced innovation at work tasks through the use of IS. Recent studies show\\nthat when employees in frontline roles use IS under positive or motivating pressures, the result can be increased\\nefficiency (eg, reducing time and effort, work faster, make fewer errors) and effectiveness (eg, improving the quality\\nof services, upselling), which results in improved performance (Wajcman & Rose, 2011). When the individual engages\\nin challenge coping behaviours such as experimentation and problem solving with IS, he or she is able to better\\nleverage IS for increased task efficiency, and experience a general overall positive feeling while using IS. Challenge\\ncoping outcomes thus may include heightened flow or enjoyment and immersion in the use of, and an overall\\npositive feeling toward, IS. Positive outcomes relating to the individual's overall job could include enhanced work\\nflexibility, greater overall work engagement, and an improved sense of work autonomy (ter Hoeven & van\\nZoonen, 2015). Understanding what these positive outcomes are, is essential to assessing the benefits of techno‐\\neustress, so that we ask: What are the positive outcomes relating to task and use of IS? How are various coping responses\\nrelated to different outcomes?\\nTARAFDAR ET AL.\\n19\\n 13652575, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/isj.12169 by Athens University Economics & Bus, Wiley Online Library on [29/01/2024].

As shown in the bottom half of Figure 2, individuals appraise the characteristics of IS as\\nthreatening and presenting pressures beyond their ability to tackle. Moreover, he or she perceives significant negative\\nconsequences to not tackling them (Ragu‐Nathan et al., 2008). Such perceptions may activate coping responses, the\\noutcomes of which constitute the containing and keeping in check of factors that are detrimental (Pearlin et al., 1981).\\nAs we see in Table 1 and Figure 2, the literature has investigated the following aspects of techno‐distress: threat\\ntechno‐stressors and negative outcomes. The other aspects have however not been adequately attended to and\\npresent greater opportunity for further research.\\n5.2.1\\n|\\nPrimary appraisal for threat techno‐stressors\\nWhile threat techno‐stressors have been discussed in the literature (eg, Ayyagari et al., 2011; Day et al., 2012;\\nRagu‐Nathan et al., 2008), why and how individuals appraise threat techno‐ stressors has not been explained. Partic-\\nular individual and organizational characteristics increase the likelihood that the characteristics of IS are perceived as\\nthreat techno‐stressors. For instance, individuals with obsessive compulsive personalities or neurotic dispositions\\ntend to interpret environmental conditions as threat stressors (Bolger & Zuckerman, 1995; Chang, 1998) because they\\nare likely to be anxious, paranoid, and prone to negative reactions to situations. They have a tendency to perceive\\ndifficult situations as threatening (Lauriola & Levin, 2001; Spector et al., 2000). Such individuals may perceive the reli-\\nability and presentism of IS as requirements for being available for work round the clock, feel insecure about missing\\nout on important matters if they are not, and feel disturbed by the blurring of boundaries between work and home,\\nthus strengthening the relationship between IS characteristics and threat techno‐stressors. Additionally, individuals\\nwith low self‐efficacy are likely to appraise greater job demands as threats (Schaubroeck & Merritt, 1997). Low tech-\\nnology self‐efficacy (Compeau & Higgins, 1995) therefore could reduce the individual's confidence in dealing with IS\\ncharacteristics such as flexibility and pace of change and increase the perception of threat associated with them.\\nIn terms of characteristics of the organization, a surveillance prone culture implies IS enabled monitoring of\\nemployees, which can generate in them, fears of job insecurity, loss of privacy, and infringement of personal space\\n(Fairweather, 1999; Zuboff, 1988, 2015). This is especially relevant for example, for organizations that monitor and\\nrecord keystroke information, call centre type telephone conservations with clients for assessing task speed and\\naccuracy, and e‐mail and Internet use (Miller & Weckert, 2000; Stanton & Weiss, 2000). In such organizations, IS\\ncharacteristics of reliability and anonymity can be perceived as enablers of even greater surveillance, further enhanc-\\ning these fears (Coovert, Thompson, & Craiger, 2005; Fairweather, 1999). Organizational expectations of availability\\nfor work, outside of work hours may force individuals to respond immediately to communication such as e‐mail, texts\\nor social networking applications (Barber & Santuzzi, 2015). Individuals in such organizations may perceive reliability\\nand presentism as threatening conditions that compel them to stay available for work all the time. At the same time,\\nthe extent to which individuals are in control over their own IS use enables them to choose when and how they use IS,\\nsuch that they feel less threatened and overwhelmed by the IS characteristics.\\nWe thus frame the following research questions: What individual and organizational factors increase the likelihood\\nthat the characteristics of IS are perceived as threat techno‐stressors? How do these factors strengthen the relationship\\nbetween technology characteristics and threat techno‐stressors?\\n5.2.2\\n|\\nThreat coping responses\\nA second under‐researched aspect is that of threat coping responses.

Coping behaviours for altering tasks could include adjusting or changing the work procedures such\\nthat they fit they better fit with the technology (Beaudry & Pinsonneault, 2005; Majchrzak, Rice, Malhotra, King, & Ba,\\n2000) and distancing or stepping away from the technology mediated task for a while (Beaudry & Pinsonneault, 2010;\\nGalluch et al., 2015) and engaging in a different activity before returning. Coping behaviours relating to IS use could be\\nlearning how to use IS to the extent required for accomplishing tasks, seeking related training and assistance, or\\navoiding or stopping use (Bala & Venkatesh, 2015; Beaudry & Pinsonneault, 2005). The intent of IS use in this way\\nwould not be for innovation or improvement, but for merely getting the task done. Changing the outlook toward a\\nthreat techno‐stressor would involve reinterpreting and viewing it in a positive light and rationalizing or minimizing\\nits supposed significance such that it appears less threatening. Such coping could include attitudes expressed by\\nremarks such as “The system is not really as bad as it is made out to be” (Beaudry & Pinsonneault, 2005). Social\\nand interpersonal behaviours can include venting, seeking social support and co‐rumination (Beaudry & Pinsonneault,\\n2010; Helgeson, Reynolds, & Tomich, 2006; Skinner & Zimmer‐Gembeck, 2011).\\nTraditionally, studies have considered negative emotions such as anger, annoyance, anxiety and frustration as\\ncoping responses, (see, for example, Lazarus, 1966). Negative emotions have been examined in the context of\\npotentially upsetting or discrepant IS situations such as implementation of new IS (Beaudry & Pinsonneault, 2010;\\nStein, Newell, Wagner, & Galliers, 2015). However, emerging ideas in stress (Folkman, 2011), drawing from positive\\npsychology (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000), are beginning to examine how positive affect can sustain individuals\\nwhen they experience stressors. Techno‐stressors, especially techno‐insecurity and techno‐uncertainty, can disturb\\nthe individual's sense of equilibrium because they disrupt valued job related aspects such as continuity and stability.\\nGoing forward, it is important to examine how positive emotions such as hope could embody positive coping affect in\\ndealing with these sorts of threat techno‐stressors.\\nWe thus ask the following research questions: What coping responses (eg, IS use related, task related, negative and\\npositive affect related) are activated to deal with threat techno‐stressors that help individuals overcome the threat?\\n5.2.3\\n|\\nSecondary appraisal for threat coping\\nSecondary appraisal for threat coping increases the likelihood that individuals engage in threat coping behaviours in\\nresponse to threat techno‐stressors. While many negative outcomes have been examined, there is no understanding\\nof how coping behaviours that influence those outcomes are activated.\\nIndividual factors influencing the selection of threat coping responses could include personality related attributes\\nsuch as optimism and resilience. These traits, in the general sense, are instrumental to whether individuals\\ndemonstrate positive or negative affect as a coping response. Specific to IS use, there is scope for developing and\\nclarifying concepts such as IT related resilience or mindfulness, and examining their influence on the extent to which\\nindividuals undertake specific coping responses.\\nOrganizational factors that could influence secondary appraisal for threat techno‐stressors should provide a\\nsupporting organizational environment (Fenlason & Beehr, 1994; Lim, 1996; O'Driscoll, Brough, Timms, & Sawang,\\n2010) in which users can engage constructively with IS related tasks even as they face threat techno‐stressors. They\\ninclude social support, technology support, and work process support. Social support from co‐workers and friends\\nincludes good personal relationships through which they can empathize, understand, and support each other in the\\ncontext of IS use (Salanova, Llorens, & Cifre, 2013; Zorn, 2003). Such socialization encourages peer learning and helps\\nindividuals to share their experiences of IS use and make positive attributions to it. Technology support includes\\norganizational mechanisms that help employees understand IS and how they can be used. They could include help\\ndesk type mechanisms for resolving technical faults (Beas & Salanova, 2006; Ragu‐Nathan et al., 2008) as well as\\nprograms that make individuals aware of issues surrounding IS use such as work life balance and help them become\\naware of options such as filtering e‐mail and switching off devices, as responses to threat stressors (Salanova, Llorens,\\n& Ventura, 2014). Work process support includes tractability in the individual's work organization such as for instance,\\nprovision of flexible schedules through teleworking (Leung, 2011; Salanova et al., 2013; Salanova et al., 2014).

We ask the following questions: What individual and organizational factors\\nincrease the likelihood of the individual activating particular threat coping responses in response to threat techno‐stressors?\\nHow do these factors influence the relationship between threat techno‐stressors and threat coping responses?\\n5.2.4\\n|\\nOutcomes\\nStudies in technostress have considered many negative outcomes. However, the focus of coping responses is to\\nregulate and manage the negative outcomes. Thus, the extent to which outcomes are negative depends on the\\nextent to which coping responses are successful (Folkman, Lazarus, Dunkel‐Schetter, DeLongis, & Gruen, 1986;\\nLazarus, 1966). For example the coping action of changing the way in which an IS is used can decrease the extent\\nof a negative outcome such as dissatisfaction with the IS to a larger degree, if the individual is skilled at using the\\nspecific IS. Similarly, the efficacy of a coping emotion such as frustration in regulating a negative outcome such as\\ndiscontinuation of IS use, might depend on the presence of others who are experiencing similar frustrations and\\ncan mutually share. Therefore, whether or not a coping response leads to satisfactory outcomes, depends on\\nthe context in which it takes places. Indeed, efficacious coping actions could lead to positive outcomes even\\nwhen threat techno‐stressors are perceived. Recent studies show that users can experience a mix of positive\\nand negative emotions that spurs them to engage to a greater extent with IS even in an IS related disruptive\\nsituation (Stein et al., 2015). Or, individuals could adopt coping actions such as problem solving and learning, which\\ncould actually increase their effectiveness of IS use (Beaudry & Pinsonneault, 2005; Ortiz de Guinea, 2016). Thus,\\nit is possible to suggest that coping responses could lead to positive outcomes even in a techno‐distress process.\\nWe ask the following questions: How do different coping responses lead to different coping outcomes? Under what\\nconditions do coping responses lead to positive and negative outcomes? How do these conditions influence the\\nrelationship between coping responses and outcomes?\\n5.3\\n|\\nDesigning IS to tackle technostress\\nThe third component of the technostress trifecta explains how IS can help mitigate techno‐distress and enhance\\ntechno‐eustress. We do this by identifying design principles for IS that can effect interventions to tackle\\ntechno‐eustress and techno‐distress. Research suggests that when individual face disruptions and stress due to IS,\\ninterventions to facilitate adjustments can be applied at 3 levels—primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary interven-\\ntion involves efforts to manage the level of the stress creating conditions. Secondary interventions focus on influencing\\nthe individual's coping response to such conditions. Tertiary interventions influence the outcomes that the individual\\nexperiences (Cooper et al., 2001; Nelson & Kletke, 1990). We draw from this framing to suggest that correspondingly,\\nIS designed to effect interventions to help tackle techno‐distress and techno‐eustress can be used by individuals at 3\\npossible points, respectively: (1) when they face challenge or threat stress creating conditions or techno‐stressors\\n(primary intervention); (2) when they execute challenge or threat coping responses (secondary intervention); and (3)\\nwhen they experience positive or negative outcomes (tertiary intervention). The research opportunity associated with\\nthe third trifecta component is thus to investigate design features of IS that can be used at each of these points as we\\nshow in Table 2.\\n5.3.1\\n|\\nDesigning IS to leverage challenge techno‐stressors and reduce threat techno‐stressors\\nIt is essential to understand the design principles for IS that help individuals deal with challenge and threat\\ntechno‐stressors, so that appropriate interventions can be effected at the very start of the techno‐distress and\\ntechno‐eustress process.

Additionally, design\\nfeatures that allow users to install, control and modify features empower them to use IS to leverage the challenge\\nstressors.\\nFeatures that might help mitigate the perception of threat stressors could include a simple design interface that is\\neasy to navigate so as to minimize techno‐complexity relating to IS use, consistent application performance and\\nfunctionality that would reduce techno‐uncertainty, information prioritization features that would decrease\\ntechno‐overload, and information on data collected that would reduce techno‐insecurity. For example, if a user feels\\nthreatened due to loss of privacy, informing employees of what data is collected and providing a design feature to opt\\nout can reduce that threat. Overall, design features that provide simplicity and clear/adequate information can reduce\\nthe extent of threat stressors (Johnson & Wiles, 2003).\\n• Thus we ask: What IS design features stimulate and empower users to leverage challenge techno‐stressors? What IS\\ndesign features provide simplicity and clarity to help individuals reduce threat techno‐stressors?\\n5.3.2\\n|\\nDesigning IS to aid in challenge and threat coping responses\\nOnce the individual has appraised a threat or challenge techno‐stressor, the next opportunity to intervene is by\\nproviding IS that assist with the individual's respective coping response. Challenge coping behaviours include task\\nand IS use innovation using IS. Such innovation involves emergent interactions between task, technology and user,\\nwhich are not scripted in advance, but arise through discussion, experimentation, adaptations, model building and\\nworkarounds, individually or in groups, as users figure out how to use the IS effectively and efficiently. It involves\\ncomplex work processes that depend on the discretion of the user (Stein et al., 2015) and are enacted through\\nmultiple devices and sources of data, as users interact with task and technology to engage in innovation for both task\\nand IS use (Alter, 2008). Thus, systems that are designed to support emergence, flow, and engagement may help\\nexecute challenge coping behaviours effectively (Alter, 2010; Campbell & Pisterman, 1996). Such systems could, for\\nexample, support the individual in workarounds, creative changes, experimentation, and model building, by providing\\nflexibility in features and interfaces.\\nThreat coping behaviours include individuals adjusting their task and use of IS, under feelings of distress and\\ndiscomfort. The focus is on learning how to use the IS effectively and applying it to their work, often only to\\nsatisfy the minimum requirements of use (Stein et al., 2015). Helpful interventions can be those that calm and/\\nor distract the individual (Weiser & Brown, 1997). Calming interventions are IS features that provide easily\\nunderstood help menus and use guidance to ease the individual's anxiety. Another calming mechanism could be\\nto provide system generated feedback that reassures the individual about their outcomes regarding task adaptation\\nor system use. For example, in an ERP system, this could be by providing a message through the system that\\ncommunicates to the user that they successfully accomplished a given task (eg, invoicing) by completing a specific\\nIS use action (eg, data entry on multiple screens into multiple tables) (Yim & Graham, 2007). Regarding distraction\\ninterventions, any features that nudge users at the point of use, to take a break, switch off, step away, breathe\\ndeeply or do something different, help to make their threat coping responses more effective. A third intervention\\ncould be in the form of group or social support. Recent research (eg, Pakenham, 2011) shows that social processes\\nsuch as collective sense‐making of threatening or disturbing situations can be an effective means of coping. IS\\nhaving features that can support such processes, such as applications having informal chat functions and postings\\ncould aid in threat coping responses.\\n• Thus we ask: What IS design features support emergent use to assist in challenge coping behaviours? What IS design\\nfeatures provide calming, distraction and support for social processes to assist in threat coping responses?\\nTARAFDAR ET AL.\\n23\\n 13652575, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/isj.12169 by Athens University Economics & Bus, Wiley Online Library on [29/01/2024].

Challenge outcomes are positive and desirable, such as\\nimproved performance, enhanced innovation, and greater mastery. The goal of the IS should be to ensure that they\\ncontinue. Design features that make individuals aware of these positive outcomes and reinforce their benefits can\\nhelp do that. Positive outcomes can be directed toward task mastery, innovation and improved performance. It may\\nbe possible to translate such outcomes into parameters that the system can measure and communicate to the\\nindividual. An example of this could be of a call centre application that keeps track of calls handled and generates\\ncongratulatory messages to users when calls are handled with increasing effectiveness and efficiency over time.\\nSuch messages could let individuals know, if they so choose, that their performance has improved, thus reinforcing\\ntheir mastery.\\nIn the case of negative outcomes, persuasive systems can measure negative outcomes, provide diagnostics, and\\nsuggest persuasion cues (Fogg, 2003). Negative outcomes regarding users' emotions could be measured through for\\ninstance, eye‐tracking devices, wearables, and instruments that track physiological parameters such as saliva, etc. Such\\nmeasurements can be processed by the system, and if the threshold exceeds a certain level specific to the individual,\\nappropriate feedback can be given to him or her if he or she so chooses. For example, if a user is multitasking on\\nseveral different application screens and is experiencing the threat stressor of techno‐overload, then the resulting\\nnegative outcome could be an increased heartbeat or eye movement. This can be sensed by the persuasive system\\nand the user presented with a screen message, which suggests to them to reduce the number of applications or to\\ntake a break. Such IS could gather information about the individual's current state, process it by comparing against\\nhis or her target conditions, and feed it back to provide assistance on the task at hand (Derrick, Jenkins, & Nunamaker,\\n2011; Oinas‐Kukkonen & Harjumaa, 2009). They could also provide a history of outcomes that individuals can\\nunderstand the situations under which they become distressed. Such a framing provides the opportunity for detecting\\na negative or distressful outcome, selecting an adjustment or intervention, implementation of the intervention and\\nrevisiting the outcome. These sorts of persuasive IS can be applied in the context of different techno‐distress\\nsituations, such as multi‐tasking on smartphones, and IS generated interruptions through e‐mail and other communi-\\ncation applications. It is important to keep in mind however that such persuasion itself should not happen in an\\nobtrusive, undesired, and consequently stressful manner (Dennison, Morrison, Conway, & Yardley, 2013; Kuonanoja,\\nLangrial, Lappalainen, Lappalainen, & Oinas‐Kukkonen, 2015).\\n• Thus we ask the following questions: What IS design features provide psychological reinforcement for improved\\nperformance, innovation and mastery to accentuate positive coping outcomes?

On the one hand, it is\\nhewn from the fundamental phenomenon of stress, and on the other, it cannot exist without, is unique to, and\\nis driven by, the design, implementation and use of IS. Research on technostress thus poses an interesting challenge.\\nOne, it needs to consider the stress phenomenon. Two, it needs to uncover insights deeply embedded in the\\ndesign, implementation and use of IS that relate to psychological stress, so as to develop an indigenous, IS‐focused\\nunderstanding of this phenomenon.\\nIn our framing of technostress we address this challenge thus. First, we note that the phenomenon of stress has\\ncertain nonspecific aspects (Selye, 1956, 1974), which exist across all stress situations. Lazarus (1966) emphasizes the\\nenduring and fundamental importance of three key nonspecific aspects in psychological stress—the stimulus\\nconditions that demand the change, how the demand is perceived and appraised, and the intervening coping related\\nprocesses that determine when and in what form the outcomes will occur. Our conceptual framing of the\\ntechno‐eustress and techno‐distress processes recognizes this. Second, and equally importantly, within this general\\nrubric, there are specific aspects that constitute contextual complexities and particularities (Cooper & Dewe, 2008;\\nLazarus, 1966). To address this, we pose research questions that focus on the design, implementation and use of IS\\nas constitutive of its specific and substantive aspects. We thus highlight the need to address concepts and relationships\\ndistinctive to IS such as, for example, challenge techno‐stressors, IS use related coping responses, IS use related\\npositive and negative outcomes, and IS design interventions to develop an IS centred understanding of these aspects.\\nSo far, research in technostress (based in the IS discipline) has primarily paid attention to the first, that is,\\nhas drawn from research in psychological stress. Through our research questions, we suggest future research\\ndirections that focus on key IS‐based concepts and relationships (involving the design and use of IS applications/\\ndevices) that constitute technostress. In doing so, we advocate applying bodies of knowledge unique to the IS discipline\\nincluding information systems management, design and use (Baskerville & Myers, 2002) to the understanding of stress\\nfrom IS use, and thus conceptually enrich the understanding of the stress phenomenon. Our framing thus embodies\\na cross‐disciplinary attribution (Tarafdar & Davison, 2018) wherein we suggest that future research in technostress\\nboth draws from and informs the non‐IS literatures (eg, psychological stress and OB) that study stress in organizations.\\nThis is particularly important because although these literatures acknowledge the stress creating effects of IS, they do\\nnot explain how the phenomenon of stress is theoretically informed by the particularities of IS use, design or\\nmanagement (Hamborg & Greif, 2009). We thus seek to guide future research in technostress in ways that would\\nmutually enrich the cognate literatures in technostress (IS), and organizational behaviour and psychological stress\\n(non‐IS).\\n6.2\\n|\\nDark side and bright side\\nTechnostress is experienced differentially by the individual, depending on whether IS characteristics are appraised as\\nchallenge or threat stressors. Each kind of experience of stress has distinct appraisal and coping processes associated\\nwith it. Techno‐eustress introduces a new theoretical aspect to the phenomenon of technostress by considering its\\npositive aspects and outcomes. With the rise of the millennial work force, current (and future) employees are using\\n(will use) IS in ways that previous generations did not (Vodanovich, Sundaram, & Myers, 2010). They experience\\nthe possibilities of using technology in unexpected and innovative ways for executing work‐life activities.

We lay out research ques-\\ntions that need to be addressed for understanding techno‐eustress and provide directions for such enquiry. In doing\\nso, we provide a conceptually enhanced description of the technostress process that delineates both the positive and\\nnegative outcomes.\\n6.3\\n|\\nIS design to tackle technostress\\nWe show how, in addition to being a cause of techno‐stress, use of IS can be a means to its mitigation. This is an\\nargument for a new and unexplored theoretical role for IS in the phenomenon of technostress. Furthermore, and in\\nline with our interdisciplinary framing, it suggests a distinctive role for IS in tackling the phenomenon of stress from\\ntechnology use, which can enrich the literature that studies stress, by contributing to it concepts relating to IS design.\\nDeveloping this argument, we suggest that IS can be designed to deliver appropriate interventions for detecting,\\nmeasuring and reducing (enhancing) the negative (positive) outcomes of techno‐distress (techno‐eustress). This line\\nof research is quite uncharted. It offers scope for incorporating design science into technostress research, to investi-\\ngate how applications, devices and wearables can be designed for measuring and monitoring technostress outcomes\\nand providing adaptation cues, potentially in real time. Further, the possibility of measuring physiological\\noutcomes offers methodological opportunities for integrating design science and neuro science within technostress\\nresearch, to look at how applications, devices and wearables can be designed and developed for detecting and\\nmanaging technostress. These embody new perspectives for the technostress literature. They are also of significance\\nto the organizational stress literature, which is beginning to acknowledge that IS can create stress, but does not\\nidentify coping and mitigation mechanisms facilitated by IS design and use. As Hamborg and Greif (2009, p. 225)\\nsuggest “the designs of workstations, hardware and software components … are important factors related to stress.”\\n6.4\\n|\\nMethods\\nThe experience of techno‐eustress and techno‐distress is highly contextual. The appraisal of challenge and threat\\nstressors, activation of coping responses, and the incidence of outcomes are determined by the specifics of the\\nsituation (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984); their identification should be salient to the objectives, research questions and\\nresearch setting of the technostress situation. Different constituents of the techno‐eustress and techno‐distress\\nprocess thus lend themselves to different kinds of research designs and methods.\\nBehavioural measures are salient for assessing the subjective aspects of the stress process such as challenge and\\nthreat techno‐stressors, as well as psychological and behavioural workplace outcomes associated with incidence of\\ntechnostress such as, for example, task innovation, problem solving, job satisfaction, and burnout.\\nNeurological and physiological outcomes are in the form of the human body's biochemical and neuroendocrine\\nparameters such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, galvanic skin response, adrenal cortical secretions, pupil\\ndilation, and brain activity (Lazarus, 1966). They have been considered in the study of technostress (Galluch et al.,\\n2015; Riedl, 2013; Tams et al., 2014). A few considerations are important in their measurement. One, they are highly\\nsubject to effects of individual‐specific factors such as age, gender, diet, genetics, physical health, work‐family\\nenvironment, and lifestyle; thus, appropriate controls should be applied. They also tend to vary with the time of\\nday and conditions such as room temperature and humidity; as such, they may need to be measured many times\\n(Bono, Glomb, Shen, Kim, & Koch, 2013). Two, they vary with the short‐ or long‐term incidence of stress. The former\\nis associated with blood pressure and hormones, while the latter with markers such as ulcers (Bailey & Bhagat, 1987;\\nBono et al., 2013). Three, many neurological and physiological markers such as salivary measurements of enzymes/\\nhormones, blood pressure, heart rate, skin conductivity, and fMRI scans are associated with both eustress and distress\\n(Lazarus, 1966; Selye, 1974). That is, the stressors may be different, yet they produce the same biological response.\\nGalluch et al. (2015) found a lack of correspondence between behavioural (techno‐distress) and physiological (hypoth-\\nesized as distress‐related) outcomes. This could be because the respondents were actually experiencing eustress, in\\nwhich case the techno‐distress related behavioural outcome would not be present, but the physiological outcome\\n26\\nTARAFDAR ET AL.\\n 13652575, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/isj.12169 by Athens University Economics & Bus, Wiley Online Library on [29/01/2024].

Disagreement among measures is a possible indication of intervening processes that may not have been\\nstudied.\\nObjective and unobtrusive system measures, which can be drawn off a system's or device's logs without the\\nindividual being aware of it, are particularly relevant for measuring technology characteristics, such as availability,\\ninterruptions and presentism, and outcomes such as system use. Such measures eliminate individual subjectivities\\npresent in physiological measures and possibly biased recall in self‐reported measures (Bailey & Bhagat, 1987).\\nGiven the plethora of possible outcomes studied in the stress literature, it is important that they should be\\ntheorized relate closely to the specific technostress situation—ie, to the combination of tasks, IS applications and\\noccupational particulars—to reveal the distinctive nature of techno‐eustress and techno‐distress–related consequences.\\nFurther, triangulation of outcomes of different types can provide greater theoretical and empirical validity.\\nWe next come to the issue of research design. Cross‐sectional research in technostress has been helpful in reveal-\\ning different constructs and their associations. Longitudinal research designs are appropriate for measuring a number\\nof dynamic aspects of the techno‐distress and techno‐eustress processes, such as the relationship between coping\\nresponses and their effects (Litt, Tennen, & Affleck, 2011). Such designs need not span several days or months; they\\ncould span the duration of a day and can aggregate findings of stressful IS use situations and responses to them over\\nmultiple daily measurements through surveys and diary studies (Bono et al., 2013; Litt et al., 2011; Maier et al., 2015).\\nExperimental design methods are appropriate for measuring episodic instances of techno‐eustress and techno‐dis-\\ntress such as interruptions (Galluch et al., 2015), multitasking, and system‐related matters. Such designs offer tight\\ncontrol over the research setting; however, they limited in the extent to which they can simulate real world situations\\nof technostress where a number of emergent, situated and simultaneous factors (eg, information processing, tasks,\\norganizational norms and policies, individual reactions, and workplace relationships) are at play.\\n6.5\\n|\\nBoundary conditions\\nFinally, we note a few boundary conditions for our exposition. First, we focus primarily on the workplace, given the\\nremarkably enduring importance of workplace stress (Cooper & Dewe, 2008) and the role of IS in contributing to that\\n(Ayyagari et al., 2011; Tarafdar, Tu, Ragu‐Nathan, & Ragu‐Nathan, 2011). The pervasiveness of IS in the non‐work\\ncontext (eg, social media, online shopping, home assistants such as Amazon's Echo) prompts us to consider if our fram-\\ning is transferable therein. Similar to stress, techno‐eustress and techno‐distress are constitutive of both specific and\\nnonspecific aspects. Thus, the broad concepts we suggest in Figure 2 would remain relevant. That is, there would be\\ndemands from IS, which would be appraised as challenging or threatening, triggering coping responses and leading to\\noutcomes. However, the preoccupation of the particulars would be different. For instance, the challenge and threat\\ntechno‐stressors will be different for online shopping applications than they would be for enterprise applications.\\nOr, outcomes such as reduced job satisfaction would become irrelevant for social media applications. Instead the\\nquality of social relationships, emotions such as envy, or neo‐luddism might become salient (eg, Krasnova, Widjaja,\\nBuxmann, Wenninger, & Benbasat, 2015; Moody & Galletta, 2015). Thus, the specific research questions and hence\\nthe potential directions of enquiry would be different, and would draw on literatures outside the management and\\norganizational domains. Second, like any literature review, ours is bounded by the time period it covers. The directions\\nfor enquiry we suggest are thus not comprehensive; as new technologies emerge, new research directions would, as well.\\n7\\n|\\nCONCLUSION\\nTechnostress is a rich and complex phenomenon. Our (re)framing for future research, thus necessarily covers a\\nnumber of aspects. Yet it is also a fledgling and rapidly growing phenomenon. Existing literature provides a good\\nfoundation and starting point for going forward. We see it as important to take stock of current understanding and\\nfocus the thrust and efforts of future research on novel, less‐understood, conceptually under‐researched, and\\npractically relevant areas.\\nTARAFDAR ET AL.\\n27\\n 13652575, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/isj.12169 by Athens University Economics & Bus, Wiley Online Library on [29/01/2024].

Specifically, it\\ndescribes how the corpus of articles was collected, selected, and reviewed, based on guidelines provided by Webster\\nand Watson (2002). The process is summarized in Table A1 below.\\nSelection of disciplinary corpus\\nFirst, we selected the disciplinary corpus that would form the focus of our search. Given the nature of the phenom-\\nenon of technostress, it was important to cover journals from the relevant fields. Studies of psychological stress in\\norganizational settings have been reported in journals from the organizational behaviour (OB), psychological stress\\nand related disciplines. The phenomenon of technostress has been studied in the IS discipline. Our search for relevant\\npapers therefore covers articles from these disciplines.\\nSelection of keywords\\nWe find that each of these disciplines has its own distinct lexicon for describing stress from use of IS. Articles in OB\\nand psychological stress journals mention stress due to information and communication technologies but not\\n‘technostress’, which is more widely attributed in the IS discipline. On the contrary, keywords that capture Information\\nSystems (IS) or Information Technology (IT) or Information and Communication Technology (ICT) may not be relevant\\nor helpful for articles from IS journals due their disciplinary focus. As a result, we ran separate investigations for each\\ndiscipline, with the query for each investigation having a distinct and different set of keywords, as shown inTable A2.\\nFor the IS journals, we searched for articles containing either technostress‐related keywords or simply stress‐related\\nkeywords. We used both the keywords ‘techno*’ and ‘stress*’ (i.e. ‘technostress’, ‘technological stress’, ‘technostressor’\\netc.). As IS articles are likely to be related to technology already, we also considered articles containing simply the\\nkeywords ‘strain’, ‘coping’, or ‘stress*’ (i.e. ‘stress’, ‘stressor’, ‘stressful’ etc.). Such queries would, for instance,\\ncapture articles on stress that individuals experience related to IS use or implementation, although such articles\\nmay not have used the words ‘technostress’. For the OB and psychological stress journals, due to their disciplinary\\nfocus, it would be irrelevant to search for articles containing the keyword ‘stress’ but not ‘technology’. These journals\\nprimarily focus on work structures and arrangements enabled by technology such as teleworking and virtual work, as\\nwell as on widely used office communication applications such as email. We thus required articles in these journals to\\nTARAFDAR ET AL.\\n33\\n 13652575, 2019, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/isj.12169 by Athens University Economics & Bus, Wiley Online Library on [29/01/2024].

For IS journals, 103\\narticles were rejected out of the 117 retrieved, leaving 14 valid articles. For non‐IS journals, 58 articles were rejected\\nout of the 66 retrieved, leaving 8 valid articles. A total of 22 articles were kept out of the 182 initially retrieved. The\\nreasons for rejecting the articles are presented in Appendix B.\\nBackward and forward search on articles selected\\nBackward and forward search was used to retrieve a further set of relevant articles, based on the originally retained\\nset from all the three. The backward search (ie, articles having been cited) was conducted by analysing the references\\nof the articles initially selected. This resulted in 1 additional article. The forward search (ie, articles having cited the\\ninitially retrieved articles) was conducted using the Web of Science search engine. The forward search returned 3\\nadditional articles. The backward and forward searches were not confined to the journals previously selected.\\nHowever, the articles retrieved from them were published largely in the initial set of journals, with two additional\\njournals, as shown in Table 2. In total, the review therefore contains 27 articles.\\nClassification of articles\\nThe final list of articles is presented in Appendices B and C. We find that the articles covered the following aspects of\\nthe phenomenon of stress: technology environmental conditions, techno‐stressors, outcomes, coping responses, and\\nmoderators of the stressor‐outcome relationship. Some of the articles covered additional aspects such as the moder-\\nators of the stressor‐outcome relationship. We recorded all the contributions for each paper under appropriate labels.\\nAt the end of this step, we produced two tables—Appendix C and Table 1 of the paper. The first tabulates each paper\\nand identifies/checks the concept(s) that it covers. The second tabulates and describes each concept, as it emerged\\ncollectively from the papers in our corpus that covered it.\\nAPPENDIX B\\nMETHODS FOR LITERATURE REVIEW: PAPERS REMOVED AFTER INITIAL\\nSCREENING\\nReasons for Removal\\nArticles Removed\\nArticlesa\\nRemoved\\nArticles containing a keyword used in a different\\nmeaning (eg, verb “to stress,” “electronic survey” …)\\nIS: (Abrahamsson, Conboy, & Xiaofeng Wang, 2009),\\n(Almklov, ∅sterlie, & Haavik, 2014), (Anderson,\\n2002), (Baskerville, 2009), (Baskerville, 2012),\\n(Bergman, Lyytinen, & Mark, 2007), (Besanko,\\nDranove, & Shanley, 2001), (Ceccagnoli, Forman,\\nHuang, & Wu, 2012), (D.
