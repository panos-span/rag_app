2.1 How the different levels of the body are affected 

The impact of IT at different levels of an organisation is both profound and complex, affecting individuals, teams and the entire organisational structure in distinct but interconnected ways.

2.1.1 Employee Efficiency Level
At the individual level, the introduction of IT brings about significant changes in job roles, ergonomics, stress levels and overall job satisfaction. This change is not only limited to the tasks individuals perform, but extends to their attitudes and perceptions towards work. As new software or IT systems are introduced, some tasks are streamlined, reducing the workload for some employees while requiring new skills or greater adaptability from others. This dual impact of facilitating certain job functions while requiring adaptability underscores the subtle effects of IT at the individual level (Er, 1989). In addition, IT plays a critical role in individual learning and skill development of employees. Individual learning, when combined with individual and collaborative IT (Information Technology), significantly influences organizational learning, indicating that IT not only changes job roles, but also contributes to the continuous development of an individual's skill set (Mercader, Meroño-Cerdán, & Sabater-Sánchez, 2006).
In addition to changes in the work environment, information technology (IT) significantly optimises organisational processes. By automating routine tasks, IT systems reduce the need for manual intervention, thus minimising errors and enhancing the accuracy of tasks. This automation leads to more efficient operations and improved data management, facilitating faster decision-making and optimised resource utilisation. The resulting cost savings and increased productivity underscore the role of IT in enhancing the overall quality of work within organizations where the positive effects of IT are particularly evident in the retail sector where the integration of IT across all channels enhances both efficiency and innovation as demonstrated in the study by Oh, Teo and Sambamurthy (2012).
Also important is the reference to the role of IT in promoting organisational innovation, where it encourages the expression of new ideas among employees. It provides the necessary infrastructure and tools for research, development and implementation of new ideas. This includes software for design and simulation, as well as platforms that facilitate collaborative innovation efforts. Organizations that leverage IT in their innovation processes are often industry leaders in the development of new products and services, as noted by Zeebaree et al. (2021). Their study shows how advances in AI, big data and business analytics contribute to organizational effectiveness and change management, highlighting the crucial role of IT in modern business innovation.
Furthermore, IT extends the reach of an organisation beyond traditional boundaries by enhancing communication with external stakeholders such as customers, suppliers and partners. This expansion includes more effective marketing, streamlined supply chain management and improved customer service. By expanding market reach and improving stakeholder relationships, IT plays a strategic role in an organization's external interactions, thereby enabling employees to perform their tasks significantly more easily and quickly.
	Finally, Kuperman (1998) highlights the role of IT in increasing efficiency by discussing how his advertising agency, Chiat/Day, uses IT. The core competency of an advertising agency is based primarily on the skills and abilities of its employees and on organizational routines and common language. Thus, to build on and enhance these capabilities, Chiat/Day's IT was designed to promote collaboration and information sharing. No longer does information have to be moved sequentially from person to person, but knowledge is posted on the web and the system notifies the correct person that a file or promotional copy has been delivered to them. As a result, the old huge manila bags and mechanical files have been replaced by "electronic work jackets" containing all the necessary information and digitized photos. This process has completely eliminated the traditional role of "traffic managers" and greatly increased the time efficiency of their common routines.

2.1.2 Organisation management level 

The influence of information technology (IT) on managers and teams in organisations includes various aspects, from decision-making to communication dynamics.
Group Support Systems (GSS) significantly influence organisational dynamics by reshaping power structures and decision-making processes, as demonstrated by the field study conducted by Williams and Wilson (1997) in a large American software company. These systems enhance the effectiveness of teamwork, particularly in terms of communication and decision-making capabilities.
The study found that GSS exert a democratizing effect on organizational power structures. This is achieved through several mechanisms. First, GSS facilitate increased participation in decision making by allowing a wider range of employees to contribute their ideas and opinions. This inclusiveness leads to a richer diversity of perspectives in decision-making, enriching the process and its outcomes.
Second, GSS improve access to critical information at different levels of the organization. Employees can easily access data and knowledge that was previously limited, allowing for more informed and data-driven decisions. Third, GSS improve access to individuals within the organization by breaking down hierarchical and geographic barriers. This promotes a more interconnected and collaborative work environment, allowing employees at all levels to reach out and collaborate more easily.
In addition, GSS help to reduce the power distance between different levels of employees. The system allows lower-level employees to express their views and ideas more freely, which upper management can listen to and take into account. This reduction of hierarchical barriers enhances communication and cooperation, making the organisation more egalitarian. Finally, GSS provide employees with increased opportunities to influence the views of others. Employees can present their ideas and feedback more effectively, thus having a greater impact on team and organizational decisions.
The concept of shared knowledge, particularly in the context of Information Systems (IS) team performance, is vital to organisational success, as explored in Nelson and Cooprider's (1996) research. This study delves into how shared knowledge, which is cultivated through mutual trust and influence between PI teams and their respective business units, significantly enhances the performance of PI departments within organizations.
Shared knowledge refers to the common understanding of IT capabilities, business processes, objectives and needs between the IT teams and line customers. The study emphasizes that mutual trust and influence are the foundation of this shared knowledge. When these elements are present, they create a conducive environment for the open and free exchange of information, leading to a comprehensive mutual understanding. This understanding is essential for aligning the efforts of the MA with the broader business objectives of the organization.
The presence of shared knowledge leads to enhanced cooperation and communication between the PI teams and other departments. Common language and understanding reduces misunderstandings and misinterpretations, facilitating more effective and efficient project execution. As a consequence, there is a noticeable improvement in the performance of CA, as evidenced by better aligned systems, user-friendly IT solutions and higher satisfaction with CA services.
Nelson and Cooprider's research provides actionable recommendations for managers aimed at fostering an environment conducive to knowledge sharing. This includes organizing regular joint meetings, forming cross-functional teams, conducting joint training sessions, and maintaining open channels of communication.
In essence, the study highlights the importance of shared knowledge to improve the performance of the MA team. By cultivating mutual trust and influence, organizations can significantly improve collaboration between the PI and business units, leading to more effective IT solutions and increased satisfaction with PI services. The findings of Nelson and Cooprider (1996) highlight the pivotal role of shared knowledge in the field of PI and its impact on overall organizational efficiency and effectiveness (Nelson & Cooprider, 1996).


The effects of information technology (IT) on an organisation's policy are complex and multifaceted, with various studies exploring different aspects of this relationship.
Butler and Gibbons' (1997) research delves into the complex interaction of social context and power in the diffusion of Information Technology (IT) in organisations, revealing how these factors have a decisive influence on the adoption and implementation of IT. At the heart of these dynamics is the recognition that organizational power structures profoundly influence IT adoption. These power dynamics are manifested in decision-making processes, control of IT resources, and the alignment of IT initiatives with the interests of powerful groups within the organization.
Based on resource dependency theory, the study suggests that the control of key resources, such as IT, grants power to specific groups or individuals, as does Davenport's well-known study on Information Politics. This power is then harnessed to influence IT implementation decisions, often leading to choices that favour the interests of these powerful stakeholders. As a result, IT diffusion is not just a technical process, but a process embedded in the political fabric of the organization. The success or failure of new technology implementations often depends on their alignment with the interests and agendas of these key stakeholders.
One of the important challenges in IT diffusion is resistance to change, which can often be attributed to these power dynamics. Groups or individuals who perceive new technologies as a threat to their established status or control may resist or even block IT initiatives. Navigating these power structures is therefore critical to successful adoption of IT.
Effective management of IT diffusion requires a strategic approach that recognises and addresses these power dynamics. This may include early engagement of key stakeholders in decision-making processes, ensuring transparent communication about the benefits of new technologies, and aligning IT initiatives with the broader goals of the organization.
An important reference is also Thomas Davenport's 1997 work "Information Ecology" which delves into the complex role of information policy in organisations and its profound implications for their management and operation. Davenport's concept of 'information ecology' is a revolutionary approach that highlights the complex interplay between technology, people and organisational structure in the field of information management.
In Davenport's view, information serves as a powerful tool within organisations, often used to exert power and influence. The control and distribution of information reflects existing power dynamics, with holders of key information often having significant influence over decisions and strategies. This aspect of information policy can lead to internal conflicts, as different groups within an organisation compete for control of information due to competing interests and agendas. Consequently, these power struggles can significantly affect the efficiency and effectiveness of information management.
In addition, the policy around information management can have a significant impact on organisational decision-making processes. Decisions may be driven not only by the quality and relevance of information, but also by who controls it, leading to decisions that are more politically motivated than purely data-oriented.
2.1.3 Level of Organisational Structure

The impact of Information Technology (IT) on the structure of organisations has been the subject of extensive research.
Phelps' (2007) study provides a detailed analysis of how the use of information technology (IT) significantly affects organizational boundaries, highlighting a subtle interaction between IT and organizational structure. Phelps presents a model that integrates transaction cost economics and knowledge-based views, offering a comprehensive perspective on the role of IT in shaping organizational dynamics.
This model suggests that organisations go through a life cycle that is influenced by the use of IT, alternating between market-oriented and hierarchical structures. As organisations increase their use of IT, they may initially move towards a decentralised, market-based structure. However, as IT needs evolve and complexities arise, there may be a shift towards a centralised organisation. This cyclical pattern shows that the impact of IT on the organisational structure is dynamic and not linear.
A key result of this increased use of IT is the development of heterogeneous network boundaries. Organizations are finding that they are engaging in more diverse and complex interactions, both internally and externally. IT allows them to extend their operational reach, collaborate across geographical and functional boundaries and become more networked and interconnected. This transformation is leading to a blurring of traditional organisational boundaries, creating a more fluid and adaptive structure.
However, the influence of IT on organisational flexibility and decision-making processes is twofold. On the one hand, IT facilitates faster communication and more efficient information processing, leading to flexible decision-making and adaptability. On the other hand, reliance on specific IT systems and protocols can introduce a degree of rigidity, potentially limiting organisational responsiveness.
The impact of IT on organisational boundaries also varies in different areas. For example, a technology company may experience increased decentralisation due to IT, while a government organisation may see its structures become more defined and rigid. This heterogeneity highlights the importance of context in understanding the impact of IT on organizational structure.
Erdurmazlı's (2021) study provides a comprehensive analysis of how Information Technology (IT) profoundly affects organizational culture and structure. He points out that the impact of IT is both direct and indirect, significantly altering organizational dynamics.
Immediately, IT reshapes organisational culture, changing the way communication and information is managed. This transformation leads to more open and transparent cultures, as information becomes more accessible to all levels of employees. Such changes in communication patterns and information accessibility directly affect cultural norms and values within an organization.
Indirectly, IT influences the organisational structure, which in turn influences the culture. IT leads to more decentralised and flexible structures by enabling remote working, virtual teams and flattened hierarchies. This structural change is driven by IT systems that facilitate faster communication and decision-making processes, often reducing the need for traditional middle management layers and leading to more networked organisational models.
The implementation of IT also revolutionises organisational processes, activities and human relations. This includes changes in teamwork, project management and performance evaluation methods. As these processes evolve under the influence of IT, they help to foster a culture that is adaptive, innovative and technology-oriented.
Erdurmazlı's study also highlights the diversity and controversy in approaches to how IT affects organizational culture and structure. Different organisations may experience these changes in different ways, influenced by existing culture, structure, industry norms and the specific IT systems in place.
For practitioners, the study highlights the importance of understanding the complex relationship between IT, organizational culture and structure to effectively manage organizational change and leverage IT for strategic success. For researchers, it opens avenues for exploring how different IT systems uniquely influence organizational culture and structure.
